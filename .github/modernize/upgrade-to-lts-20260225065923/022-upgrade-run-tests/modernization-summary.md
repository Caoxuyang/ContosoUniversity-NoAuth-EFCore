# Task 022: Run Unit Tests - Summary

## Status: Success

## Test Project Discovery

No test projects were found in the solution. The solution (`ContosoUniversity.sln`) contains only one project:
- `ContosoUniversity.csproj` (the main web application)

No `*Test*.csproj` or other test project files exist in the repository.

## Result

No unit tests to run. This is documented as a success per the task requirements ("If no tests exist, document this and mark as success").

## Recommendation

Consider adding a test project in a future task with basic smoke/integration tests for the migrated ASP.NET Core application (e.g., using xUnit and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing`).
